# NLP_project_Sentiment-Analysis-and-Web-Scraping-smapfood
This project enables users to enter a neighborhood and a dish (e.g., Pepperoni Pizza) to find restaurants on the SnappFood platform that offer the selected dish. Using Selenium for web scraping, the application collects reviews and ratings for each restaurant and performs sentiment analysis, guiding users in their dining choices.
